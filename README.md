# no-dice
A better dice app. Available at [no-dice.asdsgn.net](https://no-dice.asdsgn.net).

## Backstory

A while ago I was frustrated by the lack of a good basic dice app on the Google Play store so I decided to create my own. Nothing fancy; just basic, six-sided dice that could be rolled and saved. After an afternoon of coding and tweaking, I developed no-dice.

## Technology

No-dice is a front-end web application built with HTML/CSS and Javascript, leveraging React and Redux. No-dice also includes a serverless-side rendering function that allows the HTML of [no-dice.asdsgn.net](https://no-dice.asdsgn.net) to be served from an AWS Lambda function.
